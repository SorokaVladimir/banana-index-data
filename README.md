# The Banana index

This repository contains the data behind The Economist’s Banana index. To download the data, go to the latest release, where you can download the index data as a CSV file and open it in your program of choice, such as Excel or Google Sheets.

## Methodology
The banana index gives the greenhouse-gas emissions of foods - by weight, calorie, or protein - by their equivalent in bananas. Greenhouse-gas emissions are in CO2-equivalents, with non-CO2 gases converted according to the amount of warming they cause over a 100-year timescale. 

Mathematically, this means that for a given metric, the banana score is the ratio of emissions efficiency. For instance, strawberries bring about 5.18 kilograms of CO2-equivalents per 1000 kilocalories. Bananas bring about 0.88 kilograms of CO2-equivalents per 1000 kilocalories. Strawberries banana score, by calorie, is therefore equal to 5.18/0.88, which rounds to 6.
